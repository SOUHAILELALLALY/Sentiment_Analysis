# Sentiment_Analysis
## Objectives
In this notebook we will be doing sentiment analysis using two different techniques:  
1-VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)  
2-Roberta Pretrained Model  
3-Comparative Analysis of VADER and RoBERTa
## VADER
VADER, which stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner, is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for analyzing text data in the context of social media. It was developed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology and is intended to assess the sentiment or emotional tone of text, with a focus on understanding the sentiments expressed in short, informal, and often emotive text, such as social media posts, comments, and reviews.
## RoBERTa
RoBERTa(Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) is a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, specifically designed to improve the pretraining of deep learning models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. RoBERTa was introduced by Facebook AI researchers and builds upon the architecture and pretraining techniques of BERT while making important modifications and optimizations to enhance its performance.
